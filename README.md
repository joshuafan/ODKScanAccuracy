# ODKScanAccuracy

This repository provides methods to evaluate the accuracy of OpenDataKit's Scan app in scanning paper forms, compared to ground truth data (the actual correct values of the form). The main program is found in main/AccuracyChecker.java, which contains additional documentation. Other files contain methods to parse and compare results from Excel and JSON files.
